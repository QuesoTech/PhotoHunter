PhotoHunter
===========

    A Citizen-Scientist Game with User-in-the-loop Data Confirmation for Collecting
    Computer Vision Datasets of Geo-tagged Imagery through Crowd-Sourcing Data Collection;
    Abstracting Research using an Interactive, Game-based Mobile Application for Large
    Dataset Creation

Description
-----------

The PhotoHunter project is a system intended to simplify the creation of datasets
for computer vision research by the process of "gamification". The system is
composed of two mobile applications and a web interface. The web interface allows
researchers to specify a set of images based on their needs. Based on these
specifications, the first mobile application generates a list of descriptions for
photos. Users then capture photos matching these descriptions and submit them in a
scavenger-hunt style game. The second mobile application uses the submitted photos
to quiz users. The players are briefly shown the images and then asked to label
them. Based on the most-commonly provided answer, the correct label for the image
can be determined. The labelled images are then provided to the researchers that
requested the dataset. The system provides entertainment for users and useful
datasets for researchers.
