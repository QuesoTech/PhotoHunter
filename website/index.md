#### Bio
In 1992 I was born in Lexington, Kentucky. A little over 18 years
later, I moved far, far away from home to study [Computer
Science](http://cs.uky.edu "CS Dept.") at the [University of
Kentucky](http://uky.edu "UK"). 

Currently, I do research under [Dr. Nathan
Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs "Dr. Jacobs") with UK's Computer
Vision Group where we have done some analysis on the
[GeoFaces](http://geofaces.csr.uky.edu "GeoFaces") dataset.

I am involved with the [student ACM chapter](http://uk.acm.org "ACM"),
with whom I have had the pleasure of holding the roles of Treasurer,
President, and Vice President (at present). In the time that I have
been involved, we have grown to almost double the size I saw when I
joined in 2011, and we now have a permanent ACM Meeting Space in the
University's Engineering Annex.
