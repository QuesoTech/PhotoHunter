#### Bio
In 1993 I was born in Lexington, Kentucky. A little over 18 years
later, I moved far, far away from home to study [Computer
Science](http://cs.uky.edu "CS Dept.") at the [University of
Kentucky](http://uky.edu "UK"). 

Currently, I do research under [Dr. Nathan
Jacobs](http://cs.uky.edu/~jacobs "Dr. Jacobs") with UK's Computer
Vision Group.
